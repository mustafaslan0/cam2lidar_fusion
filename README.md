# cam2lidar_fusion
cam2lidar_fusion is a ROS 2 package that fuses data from a camera and LiDAR sensor using a projection-based method. It aligns both data sources via a manually defined transformation matrix, enhancing object detection and environmental perception by combining distance and visual information in a unified coordinate system.
