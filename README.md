# cam2lidar_fusion
The cam2lidar_fusion ROS 2 package provides a solution for fusing data from a camera and LiDAR sensor using a projection-based method, resulting in richer and more meaningful environmental perception. The package utilizes a manually defined transformation matrix to align data from both sensors into a unified coordinate system. This fusion approach enhances object detection and tracking by combining both distance and visual information, making it particularly useful for autonomous vehicles and robotic systems.

Key features:

- Synchronization of camera and LiDAR data
* Projection method using a manually defined transformation matrix
+ Improved environmental perception and object recognition through data fusion
  
This package is ideal for developers looking to improve the accuracy of systems that rely on both camera and LiDAR for environmental sensing.
